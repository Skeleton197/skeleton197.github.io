            <p> Hello my name is Robert Cervantes, I'm a Latin American, I grew up in Los Angeles California. My goals are to become a programmer and support my family even if 
i have to work myself down to the bone. I will do anything to achieve my goals because if you want something in life you give it your all or nothing at all.
The reason that i choose programing is because in the future automated machines will make almost everything but they will need programmers so I will be that 
programmer that will program the machines so they do their jobs.
</p>

I am  a fanatic for computers and games, I am also open minded to new things and like trying new stuff. 
I have tried many times to create many things in the past but failed but it has never once stopped me from thinking of new ways to improve it and many other 
things I make.  For example I made a app for the phone that was used for helping them find tutors and supplies as well as people can donate to the school via 
the app but sadly i never finished it.I have worked physically helping on a ranch moving crops. I do not mind being in harsh conditions 
and I handle emotions well so i wil not break easily.I am thinker I prefer to find better ways to do things then do them the way 
that takes less time and is ineffective.I will always be up for work because of my habit of having to constantly having to do something.

            </p>

I work well with other people even in compact areas and I will make sure that I help others if they get confused with some programs. 
I try to get along with everyone so the work environment is peaceful and everyone can work the best they possibly can. 
I like doing this because one time while I was working on a school project and no one got along so we didnâ€™t finish any work.
I have an accomplishment of being the winner of debates in my english classes which is incredibly hard to win an argument because of most the evidence that goes against you. 
The debate was about should schools have healthier and remove junk food from schools.
But in the end I will never waver in my voice when I make my arguments and I will stand my ground until proven right or wrong.
Thank you for reading about me if you want to please explore the rest of my website.
